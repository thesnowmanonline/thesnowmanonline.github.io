      <description>The Snowman Online is dedicated to helping flakes around the world with the Snowflake cloud data warehouse. The site will provide a series of blogs, tutorials and amusement for you all to enjoy and hopefully further your careers with this amazing technology.
I am just a simple Snowman. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any affiliations and my goal is just to assist and have some fun along the way. I&amp;rsquo;m always looking to improve the site so please do provide any feedback that you think may help and if you have a question please send me a mail or contact me over on twitter.</description>
